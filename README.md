# functions
Functions  I have made with javascript in order to pass some tests online.

CamelCase: Create a function where the user can input a username that includes "-, _", and the words can be capitalized in whichever way the user sees fit,
but the return will be that same username written in the camelCase method.

Likes: You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. I created the text 
that should be displayed next to such an item. Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like an item. 
It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
["Jacob", "Alex"]                 -->  "Jacob and Alex like this"
["Max", "John", "Mark"]           -->  "Max, John and Mark like this"
["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"]  -->  "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like t
